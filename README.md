# Kindle Highlights Formatter

Website: https://kindle-formatter.vercel.app/

A simple tool for cleaning up Kindle highlights exported via the desktop app. The result is plain text you can paste to your note-taking app (currently only [Roam](https://roamresearch) is supported).

Highlights are processed in the browser window and they aren't uploaded anywhere.

## Run locally

Using docker:

```
docker-compose up
```

That's it. You should be able to access the app at http://localhost:3000
